# conceptual
1. good pairwise alignments to equivalence relation, statistics for each equivalence class.
1a. Then some alignments can be prohibited based on analysis of each class.
1b. Then remainings are equally probable overlaps. Generate unitigs.

2. 2-monomers graph to canonical HORs (in short reads and long reads).
3. SNV visualization for monomers in HOR. short reads and long reads.

monomer assignment by minialign -> change relevant constants.
-> analyze variant rate inferred from short reads and error rate calculated
visualization of encoded reads; overlaps -> as a matrix tilted
k-monomers distribution

for Y
A/a B/b D/d E/e freq of them
AB Ab aB ab freq of them * 4
ABD - abd freq of 8 * 4
freq of 16 * 4
rectplot <- dotplot

# technical

DONE
check other read QV threshold > .75 for bam2fq
use of distinct monomers instead of 1868
monomers.fa.var: monomers.fa short_reads_to_mons.sam; implemented.
skip too frequent mons in freq of freq plot; data in local
data format is implemented.
1. clustering -> freqent representatives
