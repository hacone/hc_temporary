# conceptual
1. clustering -> freqent representatives
2. 2-monomers graph to canonical HORs (in short reads and long reads).
3. SNV visualization for monomers in HOR. short reads and long reads.

monomer assignment by minialign -> change relevant constants.
-> analyze variant rate inferred from short reads and error rate calculated
visualization of encoded reads; overlaps -> as a matrix tilted
k-monomers distribution

for Y
A/a B/b D/d E/e freq of them
AB Ab aB ab freq of them * 4
ABD - abd freq of 8 * 4
freq of 16 * 4

rectplot <- dotplot

# technical

DONE
check other read QV threshold > .75 for bam2fq
use of distinct monomers instead of 1868
monomers.fa.var: monomers.fa short_reads_to_mons.sam; implemented.
skip too frequent mons in freq of freq plot; data in local
data format is implemented.
